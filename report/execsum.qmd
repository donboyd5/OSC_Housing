# Executive Summary {.unnumbered}

Adequate housing is essential to people's physical, social and psychological well-being. High housing costs relative to income, overcrowded or substandard housing, and stress related to these issues can lead to greater incidence of physical and mental health problems, and greater health care costs. These challenges often are particularly severe for children.

## Housing insecurity

### High housing cost burden in New York

Over 2.6 million households in New York State -- 36 percent of all households -- have housing costs that exceed 30 percent of income. New York has the fourth-highest rate of housing cost burden among states, after California, Hawaii, and New Jersey.

The share of renters who are cost burdened in New York (47.2 percent) is far greater than the share of homeowners (26.4 percent), as is true in every state.

High housing costs relative to income are far more common in New York City (42.9 percent of households), the Mid-Hudson region (37.3 percent), and Long Island (37.2 percent) than in the rest of New York (about 25-27 percent depending on which region). In all regions, especially upstate, high cost burden for renters is more prevalent than it is for homeowners.

The 10 counties in New York with the highest cost burden rate were all downstate. This downstate concentration in part reflects high real estate prices and a high concentration of renters (for example, in New York City two-thirds of households are renters) but the factors at work vary. Suffolk County has the third-highest cost-burden rate outside New York City even though only 19.4 percent of households are renters.

Within each region, high housing cost burden is far more prevalent in urbanized areas - cities and villages - than in the remainder of the region. For example, in the Mid-Hudson region, 43.6 percent of city households had housing costs exceeding 30 percent of income, compared to 32.8 percent of households in the region living outside urbanized areas.

Although high housing cost burden is most common in downstate New York, it is a substantial problem in upstate cities as well. The prevalence of high housing cost burden in Rochester (41.5 percent) and Albany (39.9 percent) is almost as great as in New York City (42.9 percent) and in fact high housing costs, relative to income, are more common among renters in these two upstate cities than they are in New York City.

The rate of renter cost burden is consistently higher than the rate of owner cost burdens, but the gap increased over the last decade and a half[^execsum-1]. New York owner cost burdens fell substantially from a rate of 34.7 percent in 2009 to 25.8 percent in 2019, a drop of almost 9 percentage points, reflecting the fall in mortgage interest rates and the Great Recession's drop in housing prices. Over the same period the renter cost burden rate first rose slightly from 48.8 percent in 2009 to 51.4 percent in 2014, and then fell to 47.3 percent - a drop of only 1.5 percentage points over the decade. Both owner and renter cost burden rates rose between 2019 and 2021, reflecting the rise in inflation and, for owner cost burden, the rise in mortgage interest rates. The renter cost burden rate rose sharply to 50.3 percent, nearly equaling its highest rate over the last decade and a half. The owner cost burden rose to 27.2 percent in 2021, which was its second-lowest leven over the same period. Thus, the renter cost burden rate rose from 14.1 percentage points higher than the owner rate in 2009 to 23.1 percentage points higher in 2021.

[^execsum-1]: The period for which we have comparable data.

The share of both owner and renter New York households with housing costs has consistently been greater than the national share.

### Other aspects of housing insecurity

Other important elements of housing insecurity are housing crowding, inadequate plumbing and kitchen facilities, deficiencies in housing such as holes in the walls and presence of rats, and stress related to poor housing conditions and to challenges in paying for adequate housing.

Living in overcrowded housing can lead to poor mental health, food insecurity, and infectious diseases such as Meningitis, Hepatitis, and Tuberculosis; overcrowding can have negative effects on neighborhoods as well. Inadequate plumbing or kitchen facilities can pose health risks as well. Other deficiencies can make housing uninhabitable, unhealthy, or inhospitable.

Fortunately, housing crowding and inadequate plumbing and kitchen facilities are far less common than high housing costs relative to income: While 36 percent of New York houshoulds had high housing cost burden, a far smaller 5.1 percent lived in crowded housing, and 0.9 percent lived in housing with inadequate plumbing or kitchen facilities.[^execsum-2] Comparable data for the state are not available for other housing deficiencies, but data collected by New York City \[insert fact\].

[^execsum-2]: These numbers are not additive: households with crowding or inadequate facilities often are households with high cost burden. In combination, 39 percent of New York households, faced one or more of hihg housing cost burden, crowding, or inadequate plumbing or kitchen facilities.

### Characteristics of people with housing insecurity

Housing insecurity is most prevalent among low-income households and among people of color. Households headed by individuals age 75 or older have greater rates of housing insecurity than younger households.

Approximately 80 percent of New York households with income at or below the area median had one or more of the four main housing problems that HUD reports - high costs relative to income, crowding, or incomplete plumbing or kitchen facilities. In the next group of households, with income between 30 and 50 percent of the area median, 72 percent of households had one of these problems. By contrast, only 10.7 percent of households with income above the area median had one of these problems.

Approximately 56.1 percent of New York households where the householder or spouse is Hispanic (any race) have one of the four main housing problems HUD reports. By contrast, only 31.2 percent of white non-Hispanic households have one of the main housing problems. About 50.6 percent of non-Hispanic Black households and 48.2 percent of Asian households have one of the four main problems. In all regions of the state, white non-Hispanic households have lower prevalence of housing insecurity than other groups.

Households where at least one person ias age 75 or older tend to have higher rates of housing insecurity: for the state as a whole, 43.5 percent of these households had at least one of the four main housing problems reported by HUD, compared to 39.2 percent for all households. This pattern holds for most regions of the state, except for the North Country region up near the Canadian border, and to a lesser extent, the Mohawk Valley region right below it.

### Homelessness

In the latest complete count, New York had just over 91 thousand homeless people -- one in six of the nation's homeless population, second only to California's 161 thousand. New York's rate of homelessness, at 4.72 per thousand people in the general population, was the greatest of any state. (The District of Columbia has 8.95 homeless people per 1,000, or almost twice as much as New York.) The overall national rate of homelessness was 1.76 homeless people per thousand people in the general population, or less than a quarter of New York's rate.

Homelessness has been increasing rapidly in New York. The state's homeless population increased by 19.1 percent between 2010 and 2020 in a period when the overall population grew only 4.3 percent. It was the second fastest homelessness growth rate in the nation, behind South Dakota's 44.7 percent. New York's rapid growth in its homeless population dwarfs the growth in most other states.

One characteristic that sets New York apart from other states with large homeless populations is that only 5 percent of New York's homeless population is unsheltered, the lowest rate of any state. By contrast, 70 percent of California's homeless population is unsheltered, the highest rate among the states.

A major reason for New York's high shelter rate is litigation that created enforceable rights to shelter in New York City. In 1979, the Coalition for the Homeless brought a class action lawsuit on behalf of a homeless man, Robert Callahan, and all homeless men in the city, in response to city actions to turn away homeless individuals. *Callahan v. Carey* argued that the state constitution and several statutes required that the city provide shelter to all who needed it.[^execsum-3][^execsum-4] The issue was not resolved through a decision in the case but rather through a consent decree that required, among other things, that the city "shall provide shelter and board to each homeless man who applies for it provided that (a) the man meets the need standard to qualify for the home relief program established in New York State; or (b) the man by reason to physical, mental or social dysfunction is in need of temporary shelter."[^execsum-5] Robert Callahan died on the streets before the litigation was complete.[^execsum-6]

[^execsum-3]: Index No. 42582/79 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. County 1979). The case was brought against the Governor, the Commissioner of Social Services, the Mayor of New York City, the Commissioner of the New York City Human Resources Administration and other state and city government officials.

[^execsum-4]: See New York State Constitution, Article XVII, Section 1, which states: The aid, care and support of the needy are public concerns and shall be provided by the state and by such of its subdivisions, and in such manner and by such means, as the legislature may from time to time determine.

*Callahan v. Carey* was the first in a series of lawsuits that extended the right to shelter to homeless people in New York City: *Eldredge* extended the right to single homeless women, *McCain/Boston* to homeless families with minor children and pregnant women, and *C.W. v. The City of New York,* extended it to runaway and homeless youth.[^execsum-7]

A former General Counsel of the New York State Department of Social Services, the state agency responsible for homelessness programs at the time of *Callahan*, subsequently wrote that as "a result of *Callahan*, New York City has the most extensive system of shelters for homeless adults in the nation." She also wrote that "As a result of the constant focus on maintaining the standards of the Consent Decree, millions of dollars were spent to improve conditions in armories and other shelters that should never have been used to shelter anyone in the first place. The ability of the city and state to develop homeless policy in a deliberative and rational manner was impeded by the need to respond to frequent motions for enforcement of the Consent Decree."[^execsum-8]

Although the consent decree only applied to New York City, similarly low rates of unsheltered homelessness in other regions of New York suggest that state policy has led affected sheltering in other parts of the state as well.[^execsum-9] *Callahan v. Carey* has affected sheltering policies in some other states and cities as well. For example, it has been cited in decisions in Los Angeles and Chicago.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has established groupings of counties to serve and assist homeless people called "Continuums of Care", or CoCs, which generally are contiguous counties. New York's rates of homelessness vary greatly across CoCs: The New York City CoC's rate of homelessness was 9.26 per 1,000 population, more than three times as great as the Schenectady County CoC, which had the next-highest rate at 2.80 per 1,000 people in the general population. Most of the CoCs in New York with high homelessness rates, relative to other CoCs, included a city - in addition to the New York City and Schenectady CoCs, other high-homelessness CoCs include the Albany, Kingston, and Poughkeepsie CoCs. Most of the CoCs with low rates of homelessness are in rural areas, but the Buffalo and Utica CoCs are exceptions - both have rates of homelessness in the bottom 5 out of 25 CoCs in New York.
