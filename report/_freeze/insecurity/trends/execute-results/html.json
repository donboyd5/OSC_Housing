Furthermore, owner cost burdens fell substantially during the last decade, in part a result of the fall in interest rates, which lowered mortgage costs. By contrast, renter cost burdens were far more stable over most of the last decade.\n\nBoth owner cost burden and renter cost burden rose sharply in 2021, reflecting the rise inflation and, for owner cost burden, the rise in mortgage interest rates.\n\nThe share of both owner and renter New York households with housing costs has consistently been greater than the national share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-column-page-right}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trends_files/figure-html/plot-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNote: To get trends over time we have to use a slightly different data source.
