# The Impact of Recent Events on Housing Insecurity

Much of the available data on housing insecurity precedes the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent rises in inflation and interest rates. While we cannot quantify the impact of these changes on regions of New York, some research and data allow us to understand how these changes may have affected housing insecurity.

## The Impact of Rising Inflation and Higher Interest Rates

According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University the combined increases in home prices and mortgage interest rates over the past year have made buying the typical home much more expensive across the country. Between April 2021 and April 2022 the median existing home sales price in the U.S. was up 15 percent and 30-year mortgage interest rates were up nearly two percentage points, raising the cost of a mortgage significantly.
