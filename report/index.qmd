# Executive Summary {.unnumbered}

\[To come\]

## TODO:

-   Dec 2: all data included, and all major pieces done; Dec 16 draft report

-   definitely no need for town or village discussion. i tried to be thoughtful about how to limit data/presentation/discussion in terms of substate presentation for the relevant parts.

-   without necessarily showing another presentation of data, can we show whether affordability burdens are higher or lower than say 10 years ago?

-   i don't see any demographic type analysis - will that be added per the outline? perhaps we don'tneed to go into as many levels as specified in the outline, but the racial/ethnic and perhaps age categories are helpful at a minimum.

-   housing quality (maybe NYCHA?)

-   crowding:

    -   renters usually in more crowded conditions than owners - give rates

    -   Maria surprised at renter crowding rate in NYC (check - what do other sources say?)

-   are state/regional data driven by cities? If so, perhaps discuss?

-   evictions:

    -   Maria wow to high Maryland rate, much lower NY rate (figure out why this might be so)

-   Of course, add much more on federal programs...

-   And homelessness...

State table:

-   Add national average
-   Top 10 in report, full table in appendix
-   no bar chart

Regions:

-   bar chart make owners/renters clearer

Counties:

-   table top 10:
    -   as 2 tables one for owner burdens, 1 for renters,
    -   or heat maps
-   full table in appendix

Cities:

-   full table in appendix
-   maybe limit main to the top 5
