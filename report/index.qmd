# Executive Summary {.unnumbered}

Adequate housing is essential to people's physical, social and psychological well-being. High housing costs relative to income, overcrowded or substandard housing, and stress related to these issues can lead to greater incidence of physical and mental health problems, and greater health care costs. These challenges often are particularly severe for children.

## Housing insecurity

### High housing cost burden in New York

Over 2.6 million households in New York State -- 36 percent of all households -- have housing costs that exceed 30 percent of income. New York has the fourth-highest rate of housing cost burden among states, after California, Hawaii, and New Jersey.

The share of renters who are cost burdened in New York (47.2 percent) is far greater than the share of homeowners (26.4 percent), as is true in every state.

High housing costs relative to income are far more common in New York City (42.9 percent of households), the Mid-Hudson region (37.3 percent), and Long Island (37.2 percent) than in the rest of New York (about 25-27 percent depending on which region). In all regions, especially upstate, high cost burden for renters is more prevalent than it is for homeowners.

The 10 counties in New York with the highest cost burden rate were all downstate. This downstate concentration in part reflects high real estate prices and a high concentration of renters (for example, in New York City two-thirds of households are renters) but the factors at work vary. Suffolk County has the third-highest cost-burden rate outside New York City even though only 19.4 percent of households are renters.

Within each region, high housing cost burden is far more prevalent in urbanized areas - cities and villages - than in the remainder of the region. For example, in the Mid-Hudson region, 43.6 percent of city households had housing costs exceeding 30 percent of income, compared to 32.8 percent of households in the region living outside urbanized areas.

Although high housing cost burden is most common in downstate New York, it is a substantial problem in upstate cities and, to a lesser extent, in villages. The prevalence of high housing cost burden in Rochester (41.5 percent) and Albany (39.9 percent) is almost as great as in New York City (42.9 percent) and in fact high housing costs, relative to income, are more common among renters in these two upstate cities than they are in New York City.

The rate of renter cost burden is consistently higher than the rate of owner cost burdens, but the gap increased over the last decade and a half. (The period for which we have comparable data.) New York owner cost burdens fell substantially from a rate of 34.7 percent in 2009 to 25.8 percent in 2019, a drop of almost 9 percentage points, reflecting the fall in mortgage interest rates and the Great Recession's drop in housing prices. Over the same period the renter cost burden rate first rose slightly from 48.8 percent in 2009 to 51.4 percent in 2014, and then fell to 47.3 percent - a drop of only 1.5 percentage points over the decade. Both owner and renter cost burden rates rose between 2019 and 2021, reflecting the rise in inflation and, for owner cost burden, the rise in mortgage interest rates. The renter cost burden rate rose sharply to 50.3 percent, nearly equaling its highest rate over the last decade and a half. The owner cost burden rose to 27.2 percent in 2021, which was its second-lowest leven over the same period. Thus, the renter cost burden rate rose from 14.1 percentage points higher than the owner rate in 2009 to 23.1 percentage points higher in 2021.

The share of both owner and renter New York households with high housing cost burden has consistently been greater than respective national shares.

### Other aspects of housing insecurity

Other important elements of housing insecurity are housing crowding, inadequate plumbing and kitchen facilities, deficiencies in housing such as holes in the walls and presence of rats, and stress related to poor housing conditions and to challenges in paying for adequate housing.

Living in overcrowded housing can lead to poor mental health, food insecurity, and infectious diseases such as Meningitis, Hepatitis, and Tuberculosis; overcrowding can have negative effects on neighborhoods as well. Inadequate plumbing or kitchen facilities can pose health risks as well. Other deficiencies can make housing uninhabitable, unhealthy, or inhospitable.

Fortunately, housing crowding and inadequate plumbing and kitchen facilities are far less common than high housing costs relative to income: While 36 percent of New York houshoulds had high housing cost burden, a far smaller 5.1 percent lived in crowded housing, and 0.9 percent lived in housing with inadequate plumbing or kitchen facilities. (These numbers are not additive: households with crowding or inadequate facilities often are households with high cost burden.) In combination, 39 percent of New York households, faced one or more of hihg housing cost burden, crowding, or inadequate plumbing or kitchen facilities.

There are other important kinds of housing deficiencies such as presence of rodents, leaks, cracks or holes, and heating problems. Statewide data are not available for these deficients, but New York City conducts a survey of maintenance deficiencies in New York City rental housing. In the most recent survey, these deficiences affected were present in 10% to 24% of rental units.

### Characteristics of people with housing insecurity

Housing insecurity is most prevalent among low-income households and among people of color. Households headed by individuals age 75 or older have greater rates of housing insecurity than younger households.

Approximately 80 percent of New York households with income at or below the area median had one or more of the four main housing problems that HUD reports - high costs relative to income, crowding, or incomplete plumbing or kitchen facilities. In the next group of households, with income between 30 and 50 percent of the area median, 72 percent of households had one of these problems. By contrast, only 10.7 percent of households with income above the area median had one of these problems.

Approximately 56.1 percent of New York households where the householder or spouse is Hispanic (any race) have one of the four main housing problems HUD reports. By contrast, only 31.2 percent of white non-Hispanic households have one of the main housing problems. About 50.6 percent of non-Hispanic Black households and 48.2 percent of Asian households have one of the four main problems. In all regions of the state, white non-Hispanic households have lower prevalence of housing insecurity than other groups.

Households where at least one person is age 75 or older tend to have higher rates of housing insecurity: for the state as a whole, 43.5 percent of these households had at least one of the four main housing problems reported by HUD, compared to 39.2 percent for all households. This pattern holds for most regions of the state, except for the North Country region up near the Canadian border, and to a lesser extent, the Mohawk Valley region right below it.

### Homelessness

In the latest complete count, New York had just over 91 thousand homeless people -- one in six of the nation's homeless population, second only to California's 161 thousand. New York's rate of homelessness, at 4.72 per thousand people in the general population, was the greatest of any state. (The District of Columbia has 8.95 homeless people per 1,000, or almost twice as much as New York.) The overall national rate of homelessness was 1.76 homeless people per thousand people in the general population, or less than a quarter of New York's rate.

Homelessness has been increasing rapidly in New York. The state's homeless population increased by 19.1 percent between 2010 and 2020 in a period when the overall population grew only 4.3 percent. It was the second fastest homelessness growth rate in the nation, behind South Dakota's 44.7 percent. New York's rapid growth in its homeless population dwarfs the growth in most other states.

One characteristic that sets New York apart from other states with large homeless populations is that only 5 percent of New York's homeless population is unsheltered, the lowest rate of any state. By contrast, 70 percent of California's homeless population is unsheltered, the highest rate among the states. A major reason for New York's high shelter rate is litigation that created enforceable rights to shelter in New York City.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has established groupings of counties to serve and assist homeless people called "Continuums of Care", or CoCs, which generally are contiguous counties. New York's rates of homelessness vary greatly across CoCs: The New York City CoC's rate of homelessness was 9.26 per 1,000 population, more than three times as great as the Schenectady County CoC, which had the next-highest rate at 2.80 per 1,000 people in the general population. Most of the CoCs in New York with high homelessness rates, relative to other CoCs, included a city - in addition to the New York City and Schenectady CoCs, other high-homelessness CoCs include the Albany, Kingston, and Poughkeepsie CoCs. Most of the CoCs with low rates of homelessness are in rural areas, but the Buffalo and Utica CoCs are exceptions - both have rates of homelessness in the bottom 5 out of 25 CoCs in New York.

## Policies to address housing insecurity

### Federal policies

he federal government has been involved in housing assistance since the 1930s, but the federal role has changed considerably over time. Current federal policies to address housing insecurity fall into three broad categories:

-   **Rental housing assistance**, including vouchers and other mechanisms to reduce monthly costs of private housing; federally subsidized public housing owned and operated by local public housing authorities (PHAs); and special programs for the elderly and disabled, and to support rural housing;
-   **Assistance to state and local governments**, including low-income housing tax credits the federal government allocates to states, and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), and several other housing-related grants;
-   **Assistance for homeowners**, including federally insured mortgage loans and rural housing support.

Most of these policies are administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), but several are administered by other federal agencies, particularly the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Federal housing assistance was boosted dramatically in each of the last two recessions (the 2007 housing bubble and Great Recession, and the 2020 Covid-19 recession). Increases were far smaller in the 1990 and 2001 recessions.

HUD's low-income housing assistance programs assist over one million New Yorkers, and often operate in conjunction with New York State programs. In addition, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, which is administered by the Department of the Treasury, provides substantial assistance to New York.
