## Introduction[^1]

[^1]: This section draws heavily on @mccartyOverviewFederalHousing2019.

The federal government has been involved in housing assistance since the 1930s, but the federal role has changed considerably over time. Current federal policies to address housing insecurity fall into three broad categories:

-   **Rental housing assistance**, including vouchers and other mechanisms to reduce monthly costs of private housing; federally subsidized public housing owned and operated by local public housing authorities (PHAs); and special programs for the elderly and disabled, and to support rural housing;
-   **Assistance to state and local governments**, including low-income housing tax credits the federal government allocates to states, and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), and several other housing-related grants;
-   **Assistance for homeowners**, including federally insured mortgage loans and rural housing support.

Most of these policies are administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), but several are administered by other federal agencies, particularly the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Federal housing assistance was boosted dramatically in each of the last two recessions (the 2007 housing bubble and Great Recession, and the 2020 Covid-19 recession). Increases were far smaller in the 1990 and 2001 recessions. (figure below)

There have been two major trends in federal housing assistance since the 1980s:

1.  The direct federal role in **creating** assisted housing has been declining, while the state and local government role has been increasing. This reflects the end to new construction under project-based Section 8, as well as the creation of the LIHTC.
2.  Shift to tenant-based assistance; project-based rental assistance contracts between private landlords and HUD began expiring in 1980s

## Major Federal Housing Assistance Programs

### Housing Choice Vouchers (HCV)

HUD's Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program is the nation's largest form of rental assistance. It is administered through Public Housing Agencies in the states. The program provides vouchers to eligible familes; the family pays about 30 percent of its income for rent and utilities and the voucher covers the rest, up to a HUD cap. Available vouchers are capped by federal spending authorizations, and only about one in four eligible families receive vouchers.[^2] Waiting times in New York for families currently receiving vouchers were 31 months in 2020 - more than two and a half years - and this may overstate wait times because many agencies have closed their voucher waitlist.[^3]

[^3]: https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/7-22-21hous.pdf

### Community Development Block Grants (CDBG)

The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program provides annual grants on a formula basis to states, cities, and counties to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for low- and moderate-income persons.[^4]

[^4]: https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/cdbg

### Continuum of Care programs (CoC)

The Continuum of Care program is intended to assist sheltered and unsheltered homeless people by providing the housing and services needed to help individuals move into transitional and permanent housing, with the goal of long-term stability.[^5] The program encourages regional coordination. Continuums of Care are geographic entities, usually consisting of contiguous counties. Continuums of Care coordinate planning, application for federal grants under the program, and implementation of programs.

### Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG)

The Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG) program is intended to help people quickly regain stability in permanent housing after experiencing a housing crisis or homelessness. ESG provides funding to: engage homeless individuals and families living on the street; improve the number and quality of emergency shelters for homeless individuals and families; help operate these shelters; provide essential services to shelter residents; rapidly re-house homeless individuals and families; and prevent families and individuals from becoming homeless.[^6] Metropolitan cities, urban counties, territories, and states are eligible for ESG funds; states must subgrant ESG funds to local governments or private nonprofit organizations.[^7]

[^7]: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/esg/esg-requirements/

### HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME)

The HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) provides formula grants to states and localities that communities use - often in partnership with local nonprofit groups - to fund a wide range of activities including building, buying, and/or rehabilitating affordable housing for rent or homeownership or providing direct rental assistance to low-income people. HOME is the largest federal block grant to state and local governments designed exclusively to create affordable housing for low-income households.[^8]

### Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA)

The Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) Program is the only federal program dedicated to the housing needs of people living with HIV/AIDS. Under the HOPWA Program, HUD makes grants to local communities, states, and nonprofit organizations for projects that benefit low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families.[^9]

### Issues

<!-- ## Assistance for homeowners -->

<!-- ### CDBG and HOME grants -->

<!-- The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), and HOME Investments Partnership Program (HOME) are federal block grants distributed (via formula) to states and local governments. Recipients use the grant funds to carry out housing, economic development, and public improvement efforts that serve low, and moderate-income communities. Approximately 3,300 properties in NY have benefited from these grants. -->

<!-- ### HUD-subsidized households in the nation and state -->

<!-- #### Long waiting periods -->
