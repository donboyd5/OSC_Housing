# Deficiences in Housing Condition

Another aspect of housing quality or suitability to purpose, beyond crowding and adequate plumbing and kitchen facilities is physical condition or deficiencies - for example, does the heat work, are there rodents in the hallways, and are there holes in the wall. Unfortunately, data on most of these issues are not available for most of New York - the American Community Survey does not collect these data, and the American Housing Survey has limited information only for a few metropolitan areas. However, the New York City Department of Housing and Preservation and Development's periodic New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey (NYCHVS) gathers data on deficiencies.

Table 11 from the 2021 survey, reproduced below, shows the prevalence of maintenance deficiencies in New York City rental housing. The most common deficiences were the presence of rodents, leaks, cracks or holes, and heating problems, affecting as many as 10% to 24% of rental units. @newyorkcitydepartmentofhousingpreservationanddevelopment2021NewYork2022
