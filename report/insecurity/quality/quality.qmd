# Housing Quality and Conditions

## Housing Crowding

Living in overcrowded housing can lead to poor mental health, food insecurity, and infectious diseases such as Meningitis, Hepatitis, and Tuberculosis; overcrowding can have negative effects on neighborhoods as well. [@officeofdiseasepreventionandhealthpromotionQualityHousingLiterature2022], [@blakeMeasuringOvercrowdingHousing2007]

The most commonly used measure of overcrowding is persons-per-room in a dwelling unit. [@blakeMeasuringOvercrowdingHousing2007] This measure includes all rooms in a dwelling unit in the denominator, not just bedrooms. The number of persons per room generally will be lower than the number of persons per bedroom. One reason persons-per-room is used so commonly is that it can be computed readily using important data sources such as the American Community Survey (ACS) and the American Housing Survey. It is available in a crucially important data source prepared by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) known as Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS), which is used in developing housing polices. HUD develops CHAS data using detailed nonpublic ACS data, 

There is no universally accepted threshold of persons-per-room above which a housing unit is considered crowded. Some studies have used a cutoff of 1 person per room, some have used a cutoff of 1.5 persons, and others have used different thresholds depending on specific health risks being examined. An important review conducted for HUD by Econometrica, Inc. used a cutoff of 1 person per room. [@blakeMeasuringOvercrowdingHousing2007] Crowding measures based on alternative thresholds tend to be highly correlated. In the analysis below we calculate the percentage of housing units in New York and other areas that are crowded using a threshold of 1 person per room.

New York has the fourth highest crowding among the states, measured by the percentage of households with 1 or more persons per room (counting all rooms, not just bedrooms). Overcrowding was more common for renters than for homeowners.

High housing cost burden is far more prevalent in New York City, the Mid-Hudson region, and Long Island than in upstate New York. In all regions, high cost burden for renters is more prevalent than it is for homeowners; this is particularly true in upstate regions.

## Other Deficiences in Housing Condition

Another aspect of housing quality or suitability to purpose, beyond crowding and adequate plumbing and kitchen facilities, is physical condition or deficiencies - for example, does the heat work, are there rodents in the hallways, and are there holes in the wall. Unfortunately, data on most of these issues are not available for most of New York - the American Community Survey does not collect these data, and the American Housing Survey has limited information only for a few metropolitan areas. However, the New York City Department of Housing and Preservation and Development's periodic New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey (NYCHVS) gathers data on deficiencies.

Table 11 from the 2021 survey, reproduced below, shows the prevalence of maintenance deficiencies in New York City rental housing. The most common deficiences were the presence of rodents, leaks, cracks or holes, and heating problems, affecting as many as 10% to 24% of rental units. @newyorkcitydepartmentofhousingpreservationanddevelopment2021NewYork2022
