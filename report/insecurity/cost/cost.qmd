## Housing Availability and Related Measures

I mention below a few data sources under investigation.

### FHFA housing prices

-   [FHFA](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.asp) All-Transactions House Price Index, [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ATNHPIUS36001A)

    -   Counties (Developmental Index; Not Seasonally Adjusted) -- Annual House Price Indexes (see Working Papers 16-01, 16-02, and 16-04)

At the end I show price change since 2016.

### Census building permits

Monthly and annual to the county level.
