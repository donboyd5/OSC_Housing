I have computerized the data, so it is possible to produce tables, graphs, etc. However, they have a great website so in the interest of efficiency, for purposes of exploration I have simply taken some screenshots from their site.\nForeclosures - the major source appears to be RealtyTrac, via ATTOM (“ATTOM Foreclosure Data” n.d.). They do have substate estimates of foreclosures over time. I looked for a free source but have not found one. OSC has used these data in the past. (“Meltdown: The Housing Crisis and Its Impact on New York State’s Local Governments” 2008)\nHomelessness - extensive HUD data, coming soon\nHousing characteristics - I investigated the American Housing Survey but the metro-area data are quite old. For example, last reported data for the Buffalo area are for 2011.\n\nPolicies related to housing insecurity\n\nFederal\n\nHUD\nUSASpending\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nI’m just at the exploratory stage.\nThe goal is to learn about housing insecurity in New York.

    "section": "",
    "text": "There is no single accepted definition of housing insecurity, sometimes referred to as housing instability. Researchers and policymakers often consider issues such as housing cost and affordability including access to affordable suitable housing, housing quality and conditions, and housing-related stress such as stress from risks related to ability to pay for and remain in suitable housing.1\nThese definitions often take into account not just characteristics of specific housing units, but also of the neighborhoods in which they are located. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the United Nations have developed detailed and widely cited and overlapping descriptions of what they consider adequate or secure housing.2\nOne group of widely cited researchers proposed a unifying definition:3\n\nLimited or uncertain availability of stable, safe, adequate, and affordable housing and neighborhoods; limited or uncertain access to stable, safe, adequate, and affordable housing and neighborhoods; or the inability to acquire stable, safe, adequate, and affordable housing and neighborhoods in socially acceptable ways.\n\n\nWe organize our analysis in this report around three broad categories of housing insecurity: cost and affordability, quality and conditions, and housing-related stress.\n\n\n\n\nAirgood-Obrycki, Whitney, and Alexander Hermann. 2022. “Affordability Gaps Widened for Renters in the First Year of the Pandemic.” Housing Perspectives, Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/affordability-gaps-widened-renters-first-year-pandemic.\n\n\n“American Housing Survey.” n.d.

    "text": "5.1 Overcrowding and Its Consequences\nLiving in overcrowded housing can lead to poor mental health, food insecurity, and infectious diseases such as Meningitis, Hepatitis, and Tuberculosis; overcrowding can have negative effects on neighborhoods as well. (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion 2022c), (Kevin S. Blake and Rebecca L. Kellerson 2007)\nThe most commonly used measure of overcrowding is persons-per-room in a dwelling unit. (Kevin S. Blake and Rebecca L. Kellerson 2007) This measure includes all rooms in a dwelling unit in the denominator, not just bedrooms. The number of persons per room generally will be lower than the number of persons per bedroom. One reason persons-per-room is used so commonly is that it can be computed readily using important data sources such as the American Community Survey (ACS) and the American Housing Survey. It is available in a crucially important data source prepared by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) known as Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS), which is used in developing housing polices. HUD develops CHAS data using detailed nonpublic ACS data,\nThere is no universally accepted threshold of persons-per-room above which a housing unit is considered crowded. Some studies have used a cutoff of 1 person per room, some have used a cutoff of 1.5 persons, and others have used different thresholds depending on specific health risks being examined. An important review conducted for HUD by Econometrica, Inc. used a cutoff of 1 person per room. (Kevin S. Blake and Rebecca L. Kellerson 2007) Crowding measures based on alternative thresholds tend to be highly correlated. In the analysis below we calculate the percentage of housing units in New York and other areas that are crowded using a threshold of 1 person per room.\n\n5.1.1 Housing unit crowding\n\n5.1.1.1 New York compared to other states\nNew York has the fourth highest crowding rate among the states, measured by the percentage of households with more than 1 person per room on average. This is drive by New York’s #4 rank for renters, and its high percentage of households that are renters (not shown).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Housing unit crowding by state\n    \n    \n

    "text": "6.1 Evictions and risk of eviction as housing-related stress\n\n6.1.1 What is an eviction case?\n\nEviction cases are civil lawsuits filed by landlords to remove tenants from rental properties or collect past-due rent or other monetary damages (1). The filing represents only the first action in the formal eviction process. Tenants must respond to the filing, either by answering the summons or appearing in court. If the tenant fails to respond, a default judgment in favor of the plaintiff is usually issued by the court. If the tenant responds, the case proceeds and can be resolved in many ways. The case may be dismissed due to insufficient action or evidence by the landlord or because the tenant has already vacated the property. The landlord and tenant may resolve the dispute by mutual agreement, which may or may not stipulate that the tenant vacates the property or repays past-due rent. A judge may decide the case in favor of the landlord or tenant after a court trial. If a tenant is ordered by the court to vacate a property but does not leave voluntarily, the landlord can file a writ of restitution with the sheriff or marshal to forcibly remove the tenant. (Ashley Gromis et al. 2022)\n\n\n\n6.1.2 About the data\nThe Eviction Lab at Princeton University has developed a database of eviction filings, att the county level, for 2000-2018. It collects eviction data directly from state and local courts, and uses statistical models to estimate data where it is unable to collect it directly. (Ashley Gromis et al. 2022)\nThey constructed two measures of evictions: (1) eviction filings, and (2) households threatened by eviction. Multiple eviction filings can be applicable to a single household, so they are not unique counts.\nThey divided these measures by the number of rental households to arrive at eviction rates and rates of households threatened with eviction.\nAccording to The Eviction Lab:\n\nWe used three strategies to collect eviction case data. First, we made bulk requests for individual electronic records directly to the state courts in all states and DC.We requested all publicly available case records, regardless of when the case was originally filed. We received electronic records directly from 16 states and five counties….\nSecond, we also requested annual, aggregated counts of eviction filings at the county level from state and county courts….\nThird, we purchased proprietary individual records data from LexisNexis Risk Solutions (Lexis- Nexis). LexisNexis conducts automated and in-person bulk collection of records from local civil and housing courts in most states….\n\nThey did considerable data cleaning after collection. They noted that “the proprietary data typically undercounted filing volume relative to court-issued data, although the cariability of the measurement error differed considerably across states.” Thus, they developed a model to estimate court-issued data, using data in areas where they had both court-issued and proprietary data. They used this model to estimate court-issued evictions in areas where they do not have court-issued data.\nThe data for NY are based on actual filings for the counties in New York City. The data for counties outside NYC are estimated.\n\n\n\nThe Eviction Lab constructed 95% confidence intervals for their estimates, and they are pretty large. For example, the table below shows the estimated eviction filing rate and threat rate for Bronx and Fulton counties, and the 95% confidence interval around each. Not surprisingly, the confidence intervals are much smaller for the Bronx than for Fulton (for the Bronx, the upper bound for eviction filing rate is about twice the lower bound; for Fulton, it is about 6 times as large).\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Eviction prevalence nationally\nThe map below, screenshotted from their webpage, shows state-level eviction filing rates in 2018 across the U.S.. The larger the red bubble the higher the rate. (The location of the bubble is simply the state centroid - New York’s bubble primarily reflects evictions in New York City, although it is placed in the center of the state.)\nMaryland’s eviction filing rate was 69.6 eviction filings per 100 renter households. New York’s was 9 evictions filed per 100 households, somewhat behind New Jersey’s rate of 12.1.\n\nThe next map shows the eviction threat rate (unique households as percent of renter households). It appears reasonably correlated with the eviction filing rate.\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Eviction prevalence in New York\nThe map below shows 2018 eviction threat rates by county in New York. The highest rate appears to be 15.9% pf renter households in the Bronx. However, many upstate counties have pretty high (estimated) rates. For example, the eviction threat rate in Fulton County (immediately west of Saratoga County) is 15.6 percent (with a large confidence interval, as noted above).\n\nThe table below shows the data for Bronx and Fulton."

From 2019 to 2020, the share of renter households with cost burdens rose nearly 3 percentage points. Among renters, the pandemic widened socioeconomic and racial inequalities in housing cost burdens. (Airgood-Obrycki and Hermann 2022)\nBefore the pandemic, cost burdens were highest for lower-income renter households and rising fastest among middle-income renters. This trend continued in the first year of the pandemic. Cost burdens increased by nearly 5 percentage points, to 80 percent, for households making less than $30,000. Renters making $30,000–45,000 saw their cost burden rate jump by 9 percentage points to 58 percent, while those making $45,000–75,000 had a cost-burden rate of 30 percent, a 5-percentage-point rise from 2019. Cost burdens rose fastest among renter households headed by a Black person, widening the existing Black-white affordability gap. (Airgood-Obrycki and Hermann 2022)\nWith eviction and foreclosure moratoriums now ended, housing insecurity is on the rise. (Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University 2022)"

Between April 2021 and April 2022 the median existing home sales price in the U.S. was up 15 percent and 30-year mortgage interest rates were up nearly two percentage points, raising the cost of a mortgage significantly. (Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University 2022) As a result, a potential homebuyer would have needed an income of at least $107,600 to qualify for a mortgage on the median-priced home in April of 2022, up from $79,600 in April 2021, pricing roughly 4 million renter households out of home ownership.

New York’s eviction protections for renters impacted by the pandemic are now one of the most expansive in the nation.23 Although the state, like many others, has struggled to disburse billions of dollars in rent relief, the extended eviction protections will potentially keep hundreds of thousands of struggling residents in their homes while they await emergency rental assistance. As of August 31, 2021, New York has obligated or distributed more than $1.2 billion in funding, including more than $300 million in direct payments to more than 23,000 landlords.24 The City of Philadelphia rolled out a robust Eviction Diversion Program, which involves mediation between landlords and tenants before an eviction can proceed.25 Eviction diversion programs not only keep parties out of costly court hearings, they also encourage reluctant or unaware tenants and landlords to access rent relief. A roundtable participant commented that the availability of rental assistance funds allowed for the City of Philadelphia to work in partnership with local court systems to address issues around nonpayment and avert evictions. As of July 2021, 91.2% of households that completed Philadelphia’s mediation program avoided an eviction proceeding.26\n\n\n\n\nAirgood-Obrycki, Whitney, and Alexander Hermann. 2022. “Affordability Gaps Widened for Renters in the First Year of the Pandemic.” Housing Perspectives, Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/affordability-gaps-widened-renters-first-year-pandemic.\n\n\n“American Housing Survey.” n.d.

    "section": "16.1 CHAS data",
    "text": "16.1 CHAS data\n\nHUD CHAS data\n\n\nOn September 29, 2021 HUD released updated CHAS data for the 2014-2018 period…\nEach year, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) receives custom tabulations of American Community Survey (ACS) data from the U.S. Census Bureau. These data, known as the “CHAS” data (Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy), demonstrate the extent of housing problems and housing needs, particularly for low income households. The CHAS data are used by local governments to plan how to spend HUD funds, and may also be used by HUD to distribute grant funds.\n\n\nCHAS Background\n\n\nThe primary purpose of the CHAS data is to demonstrate the number of households in need of housing assistance. This is estimated by the number of households that have certain housing problems and have income low enough to qualify for HUD’s programs (primarily 30, 50, and 80 percent of median income). It is also important to consider the prevalence of housing problems among different types of households, such as the elderly, disabled, minorities, and different household types. The CHAS data provide counts of the numbers of households that fit these HUD-specified characteristics in HUD-specified geographic areas.\nIn addition to estimating low-income housing needs, the CHAS data contribute to a more comprehensive market analysis by documenting issues like lead paint risks, “affordability mismatch,” and the interaction of affordability with variables like age of homes, number of bedrooms, and type of building. Data Format\nHUD has identified a large set of characteristics of interest to housing planners and policy-makers, and as a result the CHAS data can be quite unwieldy. To streamline the data and make it easier to use, HUD has created a series of “tables,” which are grouped by theme.\n\n\nEach of these tables contains certain “dimensions” (also referred to as variables). These dimensions can be combined in a number of ways, and the data files for each table present every possible combination of those dimensions. As an example, consider Table 11. Table 11 contains 3 dimensions: tenure, housing problems, and household income. Tenure has 2 options: owner-occupied or renter-occupied. Housing problems has 3 options: household has at least one housing problem, household has no housing problems, or household has no income (so cost burden could not be computed) but no other housing problems. Household income, in this particular table, has 13 options. Thus Table 11 essentially has 78 buckets (2313=78), and every household belongs in one (and only one) of those buckets. In the CHAS data, we have counted the number of households in each of those buckets, for thousands of states, counties, cities, and neighborhoods.\nBecause CHAS provides count estimates, users interested in percentage estimates (e.g. percentage of low-income renters with severe housing cost burden) will need to make the calculation themselves. To make these calculations, users may need to sum count estimates (buckets) in both the numerator and denominator before dividing to obtain the percentage estimate. Users should be careful to identify the appropriate total or subtotal that serves as the denominator. In some cases, totals and subtotals are provided in the CHAS data.\n\n\nCHAS downloads\nCHAS documentation\nhttps://acsdatacommunity.prb.org/discussion-forum/f/forum/435/acs-table-for-severe-housing-burden\nHAMFI – HUD Area Median Family Income. This is the median family income calculated by HUD for each jurisdiction, in order to determine Fair Market Rents (FMRs) and income limits for HUD programs. HAMFI will not necessarily be the same as other calculations of median incomes (such as a simple Census number), due to a series of adjustments that are made (For full documentation of these adjustments, consult the HUD Income Limit Briefing Materials). If you see the terms “area median income” (AMI) or “median family income” (MFI) used in the CHAS, assume it refers to HAMFI.\nHousing Problems – There are four housing problems in the CHAS data: 1) housing unit lacks complete kitchen facilities; 2) housing unit lacks complete plumbing facilities; 3) household is overcrowded; and 4) household is cost burdened. A household is said to have a housing problem if they have any 1 or more of these 4 problems.\nData for related important measures.\n\nOvercrowding – More than 1 person per room.\nSevere overcrowding – More than 1.5 persons per room.\nCost burden – Monthly housing costs (including utilities) exceeding 30% of monthly income.\nSevere cost burden – Monthly housing costs (including utilities) exceeding 50% of monthly income.\n\nhttps://acsdatacommunity.prb.org/discussion-forum/f/forum/597/chas-vs-acs-for-housing-problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirgood-Obrycki, Whitney, and Alexander Hermann. 2022. “Affordability Gaps Widened for Renters in the First Year of the Pandemic.” Housing Perspectives, Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/affordability-gaps-widened-renters-first-year-pandemic.\n\n\n“American Housing Survey.” n.d.
