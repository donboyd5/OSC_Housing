# Welcome to HUD's Community Assessment Reporting Tool (CART) CART is a
# reference tool designed by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development
# to display HUD's investments in communities across the United States. Use the
# Search bar to enter a name of a City, County, Metropolitan Area or State to
# see many of HUD's investments or use the Advanced Search for more options.
# CART can easily generate reports in PDF and Excel.
#
# Disclaimer By using this tool, you accept this disclaimer in full. The data
# used in this report are intended for informational purposes only and allow the
# user to more effectively access funding information pertaining to their
# specific jurisdiction or community. HUD does not represent, warrant, undertake
# or guarantee that the data displayed are the most current information, as data
# are only as up to date as the most recent extract. Data elements may be
# updated at different schedules. Additionally, pie charts may not equal 100%
# due to rounding errors. Please consult with your local HUD office for the most
# recent information and/or for more information pertaining to funding data. If
# you have questions or concerns, please contact your local HUD office for
# verification and interpretation of this data.
#
# The information provided in this tool is based on HUD's administrative systems
# and Census data. The funding and expenditure data portrayed in this tool may
# be estimated due to the limitation of available data on place of performance
# in HUD Administrative Systems or to the fact that community boundaries do not
# necessarily align with HUD program jurisdictions. Additionally the information
# provided in CART is not intended to be a comprehensive accounting of all HUD
# programs and/or grants administered within a community. Rather it is HUD's
# intent to focus on the programs that make up the majority of HUD's budget. For
# a more detailed list of programs, please contact your local HUD office.
#
# For buildings containing 10 or fewer tenants receiving HUD assistance (public
# housing and other multifamily assistance), some information has been redacted
# to protect against an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Redacted
# information will be clearly marked as "###". In such a case, the small
# population size prevents HUD from releasing specific numbers in order to
# comply with HUD's obligations to protect personally identifiable information
# under the Privacy Act.
#
# Finally, for the purposes of CART, HUD defines a community as one of the
# following: a Unit of General Local Government (UGLG), a Congressional
# District, a Metropolitan Statistical Area, a County, or a State. If a
# jurisdiction cannot be found in this tool, please contact your local HUD field
# office for programmatic and funding information.
