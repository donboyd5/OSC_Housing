"description": "Rent estimates at the 50th percentile (or median) are calculated for all Fair Market Rent areas. Fair Market Rents (FMRs) are primarily used to determine payment standard amounts for the Housing Choice Voucher program, to determine initial renewal rents for some expiring project-based Section 8 contracts, to determine initial rents for housing assistance payment (HAP) contracts in the Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy program (Mod Rehab), and to serve as a rent ceiling in the HOME rental assistance program. FMRs are gross rent estimates. They include the shelter rent plus the cost of all tenant-paid utilities, except telephones, cable or satellite television service, and internet service. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) annually estimates FMRs for 530 metropolitan areas and 2,045 nonmetropolitan county FMR areas. Under certain conditions, as set forth in the Interim Rule (Federal Register Vol. 65, No. 191, Monday October 2, 2000, pages 58870-58875), these 50th percentile rents can be used to set success rate payment standards.",

Since housing assistance is provided on behalf of the family or individual, participants are able to find their own housing, including single-family homes, townhouses and apartments. The participant is free to choose any housing that meets the requirements of the program and is not limited to units located in subsidized housing projects. Housing choice vouchers (HCV) are administered locally by public housing agencies (PHAs). The PHAs receive federal funds from HUD to administer the voucher program. A family that is issued a housing voucher is responsible for finding a suitable housing unit where the owner agrees to rent under the program. This unit may include the family's present residence. Rental units must meet minimum standards of health and safety, as determined by the PHA. A housing subsidy is paid to the landlord directly by the PHA on behalf of the participating family. The family then pays the difference between the actual rent charged by the landlord and the amount subsidized by the program. Under certain circumstances, if authorized by the PHA, a family may use its voucher to purchase a modest home.HCV locations are identified in public records by the owner and not the tenant so access to this information is restricted to help safeguard the location of HCV units. Due to the sensitive nature of the HCV locations, these are aggregated to the U.S. Census Bureau?s census tract geography.",

The LIHTC database, created by HUD and available to the public since 1997, contains information on 33,777 projects and almost 2,203,000 housing units placed in service between 1987 and 2010. Created by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the LIHTC program gives State and local LIHTC-allocating agencies the equivalent of nearly $8 billion in annual budget authority to issue tax credits for the acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction of rental housing targeted to lower-income households. Although some data about the program have been made available by various sources, HUD's database is the only complete national source of information on the size, unit mix, and location of individual projects. With the continued support of the national LIHTC database, HUD hopes to enable researchers to learn more about the effects of the tax credit program. The LIHTC property locations depicted in this map service represent the general location of the property. The locations of individual buildings associated with each property are not depicted here.

The file includes the following population items: sex, age, race, Hispanic or Latino origin, household relationship, and household and family characteristics. Housing items include occupancy status and tenure (whether the unit is owner or renter occupied). SF1 does not include information on incomes, poverty status, overcrowded housing or age of housing. These topics will be covered in Summary File 3. Data are available for states, counties, county subdivisions, places, census tracts, block groups, and, where applicable, American Indian and Alaskan Native Areas and Hawaiian Home Lands. The SF1 data are available on the Bureau's web site and may be retrieved from American FactFinder as tables, lists, or maps. Users may also download a set of compressed ASCII files for each state via the Bureau's FTP server. There are over 8000 data items available for each geographic area. The full listing of these data items is available here as a downloadable compressed data base file named TABLES.ZIP. The uncompressed is in FoxPro data base file (dbf) format and may be imported to ACCESS, EXCEL, and other software formats. While all of this information is useful, the Office of Community Planning and Development has downloaded selected information for all states and areas and is making this information available on the CPD web pages. The tables and data items selected are those items used in the CDBG and HOME allocation formulas plus topics most pertinent to the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS), the Consolidated Plan, and similar overall economic and community development plans. The information is contained in five compressed (zipped) dbf tables for each state. When uncompressed the tables are ready for use with FoxPro and they can be imported into ACCESS, EXCEL, and other spreadsheet, GIS and database software. The data are at the block group summary level. The first two characters of the file name are the state abbreviation. The next two letters are BG for block group. Each record is labeled with the code and name of the city and county in which it is located so that the data can be summarized to higher-level geography. The last part of the file name describes the contents . The GEO file contains standard Census Bureau geographic identifiers for each block group, such as the metropolitan area code and congressional district code. The only data included in this table is total population and total housing units. POP1 and POP2 contain selected population variables and selected housing items are in the HU file. The MA05 table data is only for use by State CDBG grantees for the reporting of the racial composition of beneficiaries of Area Benefit activities. The complete package for a state consists of the dictionary file named TABLES, and the five data files for the state. The logical record number (LOGRECNO) links the records across tables.",

Toolkit capabilities include mapping and saving addresses and other custom locations, producing custom routes with intermediate waypoints, and producing custom maps with annotation. Since 2013, the toolkit has also included annually updated block group level datasets of American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates that allow communities to explore ACS data on demographic, housing, and economic characteristics at the neighborhood and regional level. Current Toolkit ACS data cover the latest available 5-year period, 2010-14. Since 2014, the Toolkit has included Housing Inventory Count (HIC) data visualization by geocode. Users can query the map by program type for sheltered PIT data, beds reported by population served, and more.\r\n\r\nUsers access pre-compiled projects through a free software product called ArcReader, and are able to open and explore HUD specific project data as well as design and print custom maps. No special software or map skills beyond basic computer skills are required, meaning users can quickly get started working with maps of their communities."

"description": "Continuum of Care (CoC) Homeless Assistance Programs Housing Inventory Count Reports are a snapshot of a CoC’s housing inventory, available at the national and state level, and for each CoC. The reports are based on the Housing Inventory Count (HIC), an inventory of housing conducted on a single night during the last ten days in January. It reflects the number of beds and units available on the night designated for the count that are dedicated to serve persons who are homeless. The HIC also includes information about unmet need.\r\nNote: This information has not been independently verified by HUD. Where possible, CoCs are encouraged to use HMIS data to generate the HIC. Since compliance with these standards may vary, the reliability and consistency of the homeless counts may also vary among CoCs. Additionally, a shift in the methodology a CoC uses to count the homeless may cause a change in homeless counts between reporting periods. These reports are available annually starting from 2005.",

The programs administered by HUD award funds competitively and require the development of a Continuum of Care system in the community where assistance is being sought. A continuum of care system is designed to address the critical problem of homelessness through a coordinated community-based process of identifying needs and building a system to address those needs. The approach is predicated on the understanding that homelessness is not caused merely by a lack of shelter, but involves a variety of underlying, unmet needs - physical, economic, and social. Funds are granted based on the competition following the Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA).",

"description": "The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (Safety and Soundness Act) provides for the establishment of single-family and multifamily goals each year, including a single-family purchase money mortgage goal for families residing in low-income areas.  The Safety and Soundness Act defines \"low-income area\" as: (a) census tracts or block numbering areas in which the median income does not exceed 80 percent of area median income (AMI), (b) families with income not greater than 100 percent of AMI who reside in minority census tracts, and (c) families with income not greater than 100 percent of AMI who reside in designated disaster areas.  A “minority census tract” is a census tract that has a minority population of at least 30 percent and a median income of less than 100 percent of the AMI.  Census tract level data identifying these areas are available below for 2010 and 2011 based on 2000 Census tract geography, and for 2012 and subsequent years based on 2010 Census tract geography.\r\n\r\n?As in the previous underserved area definition, low-income area and minority census tract definitions are based on prior year metropolitan area definitions as determined by OMB.  Designated disaster areas are identified by FHFA based on the three most recent years' declarations by the Federal Emergency Management Agency? (FEMA), where individual assistance payments were authorized by FEMA.  Each file includes a map of the counties identified as designated disaster areas and a description of the data layout, also available separately.",

Performance Profiles are available at the national level and by individual grantee. Competitive grantees may have multiple grants at a given time, therefore some competitive grantees have more than one report per year. For a given year, the most recent quarterly report replaces the previous quarterly report. The national HOPWA performance profiles represent data as received by HUD HQ. Under the Consolidated Plan process, at the end of that program year, formula grantees compile information on housing outputs and client outcomes from all project sponsors and submit a HOPWA grantee summary (within 90 days) to HUD's area field office and the HQ Office of HIV/AIDS Housing. The HOPWA section is also part of their CAPER report that provides public information on their formula program accomplishments. Grantees also report related project and client data in a HOPWA beneficiary worksheet (pending related enhancements to IDIS for this information) on the assistance provided to beneficiaries during this operating period. Similarly, HOPWA competitive renewal grants report at the end of each of their contract years in Annual Progress Reports (APR). Program operating years vary by grant. By contrast, data on expenditures is tracked in a live manner, based on current disbursements filed with the Department's accounting systems. Note: Data collection and validation actions are pending with some reports. Profiles with no data mean that the grantee has yet to submit their performance report.",

The HUD Subprime and Manufactured home Lender List contains the names of those lenders, their agency codes, and lender identification numbers. The agency code and lender identification numbers should be used to link to the individual HMDA loan application records (LARS). The file also contains a concatenated field, IDD, which is a combination of the agency code and lender identification number. The HUD Subprime and Manufactured home Lender List has annually been updated and revised in response to feedback from lenders, policy analysts, housing advocacy groups, and other users of the list.

About 20,000 such inspections are conducted each year to ensure that assisted families have housing that is decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair. This page provides a full historical view of the results of those inspections, providing point-in-time property scores. Results are available for download as a comma-delimited dataset. Separate datasets are available for public housing and for multifamily assisted properties. The results represent the inspections conducted from 2001 through January 2015. The dataset includes property identifiers and location information. \r\n\r\nDetailed descriptions of the inspection processes can be found in Federal Register notices 66 FR 59084 for public housing and 65 FR77230 for Office of Housing programs. \r\n\r\nMaking these inspection details available will enable researchers, advocacy groups and the general public to \r\n 1) better understand the physical condition of the HUD-assisted housing stock, as well as changes in the stock over time;\r\n 2) hold providers accountable for housing quality; and \r\n3) plan for future affordable housing needs.",

"description": "The data being displayed are census tract level counts of NSP-funded activities and is derived from an extract of HUD's Community Planning and Development?s (CPD) Disaster Recovery Grants Reporting (DRGR) System. Each observation in the raw DRGR extract is an address at which an NSP activity took place. If multiple activities took place at one address, that address would be in the database multiple times and may over-count NSP activity. This situation is likely if a grantee reports the same property under an ?acquisition? activity and a ?rehab? activity. The data will also over-count NSP activity if grantees enter an activity at a single address in multiple quarterly performance reports. Conversely, if multiple units were assisted at a single address, that address may under-represent NSP activity. This situation is likely if a grantee reports a single address that actually represents a group of properties or a property with multiple units. The observations were reported by grantees as completed through March 31, 2011. A ?completed? activity has met its national objective; for NSP-funded units this frequently means it has been occupied by a low or moderate income household. Only addresses that were geocoded to a high level of accuracy were included.",

The Section 8 Rental Voucher Program increases affordable housing choices for very low-income households by allowing families to choose privately owned rental housing. Through the Section 8 Rental Voucher Program, the administering housing authority issues a voucher to an income-qualified household, which then finds a unit to rent. If the unit meets the Section 8 quality standards, the PHA then pays the landlord the amount equal to the difference between 30 percent of the tenant's adjusted income (or 10 percent of the gross income or the portion of welfare assistance designated for housing) and the PHA-determined payment standard for the area. The rent must be reasonable compared with similar unassisted units.",

About 20,000 such inspections are conducted each year to ensure that assisted families have housing that is decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair. This page provides a full historical view of the results of those inspections, providing point-in-time property scores. Results are available for download as a comma-delimited dataset. Separate datasets are available for public housing and for multifamily assisted properties. The results represent the inspections conducted from 2001 through January 2015. The dataset includes property identifiers and location information. \r\n\r\nDetailed descriptions of the inspection processes can be found in Federal Register notices 66 FR 59084 for public housing and 65 FR77230 for Office of Housing programs. \r\n\r\nMaking these inspection details available will enable researchers, advocacy groups and the general public to \r\n 1) better understand the physical condition of the HUD-assisted housing stock, as well as changes in the stock over time;\r\n 2) hold providers accountable for housing quality; and \r\n3) plan for future affordable housing needs.",

The SCRP program is a key initiative of the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, in which HUD works with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to coordinate and leverage programs and investments.",
